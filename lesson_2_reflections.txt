What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The .git meta-data-file is created, which is a prerequisite for git tracking versions

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
commits added to the staging area are not affected by changes in the working directory anymore.
But as they are not immediately put into the log of the repository, it provides git with a clear overview.
